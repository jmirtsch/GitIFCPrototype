# GitIFCPrototype
First Public prototype of Git IFC Folder based serialization
Contact jonm@geometrygym.com for more details.

This is the first implemenation of this, lots of improvements to make.
Obvious ones include ownerhistory file names with time stamp and change state.


Issues and Aspects to consider:
Long path names require Windows 10 (or beyond).
Many drive structures are case insensitive (unlikely but potential guid clash).
The folder serialization of IFC and use of ifcjson are work-in-progress explorations of alternative expressions of IFC from official Building Smart offerings.
The file to repository and merge routines are not yet comprehensively implemented or publicly available but contact Jon if you would like to access this.
